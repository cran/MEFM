Description: To perform main effect matrix factor model (MEFM) estimation for a given matrix time series as described in Lam and Cen (2024) <doi:10.48550/arXiv.2406.00128>. Estimation of traditional matrix factor models is also supported. Supplementary functions for testing MEFM over factor models are included.
